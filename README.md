# Deep Learning Specialization on Coursera (offered by deeplearning.ai)

Programming assignments and quizzes from all courses in the Coursera [Deep Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning) offered by `deeplearning.ai`.

Instructor: [Andrew Ng](http://www.andrewng.org/)

## Credits

This repo contains my work for this specialization. The code base, quizes, diagrams and materials are taken from the [https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization](https://github.com/amanchadha/coursera-deep-learning-specialization). My work was to complete some compicated tasks for example backprop for CNN ets. and achieve better perfomance in some homeworks.
